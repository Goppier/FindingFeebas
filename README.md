# Finding Feebas
In this repository you will find the python code to a tool to find Feebas more quickly in your games! Before you can use it, there are a few things you will need to install if you don't have it already.
## Step 1: Install Python and Libraries
You will first need to download and install Python for the OS you are using. You find Python using the link below:

https://www.python.org/downloads/

Once Python has been installed, open the terminal and type in the following command:
- pip3 install tkinter

## Step 2: Download the Repository and Run the Code
1. Download the entire source code from the latest release on github and unzip it.
2. Use the terminal to navigate to the unzipped folder. You can also open a new terminal in the unzipped folder. This can usually be done easily by holding "shift" and then press the right mouse button while in the folder using the file explorer.
3. Type in the command below to run the tool!
    - python3 main.py

## Step 3: Using the Tool
You've probably already seen the video and know how to use it from here, but just in case here are the instructions
1. Restart your game without a working battery
2. Start a new game within 5 and a half minutes. In Emerald your time limit starts after confirming your name. In Ruby/Sapphire your time limit starts the moment the game is booted.
3. Play the game up until you have access to the Department Store in Lilycove City
4. Take note of the following values in the game:
    - Trainer ID
    - Trendy Phrase from Dewford Town (Do NOT change this when he asks you to!!)
    - Lottery Number from the Department Store in Lilycove City
  
5. Enter all the values into the tool and press the calculate button. If all the steps were done successfully, then the tool should now show the Feebas spots in the map on the left.
6. Fish for Feebas in your game!
